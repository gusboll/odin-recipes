    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Two sticks of butter</strong> creamed with <strong>white and brown sugars</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Eggs</strong> add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla extract</strong> enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies</li>
        <li><strong>Baking soda</strong> acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise</li>
        <li>A bit of <strong>hot water</strong> creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up</li>
        <li>A <strong>pinch of salt</strong> enhances the falovrs of the others ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty</li>
        <li><strong>All-purpose flour</strong> helps create gluten, which add structure to the cookie dough</li>
        <li>Of course, you'll need <strong>semisweet chocolate chips</strong>! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer</li>
        <li><strong>Walnuts</strong> are optional, but they add nutty flavor and a welcome crunch</li>
    </ul>
