    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>scant 1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>4 (6 ounce) chicken breast cutlets</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry white whine</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cold unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>fresh minced parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step by step</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
        <li>In a large resealable plastic bag, combine flour, salt, pepper, granulated garlic and paprika. Mix the dry ingredients inside the bag by pinching the bag several times</li>
        <li>Pound chicken cutlets to 1/2-inch thickness on a work surface and add to the flour mixture. Seal the bag, and toss and move chicken inside the bag until lightly coated with flour mixture</li>
        <li>Heat butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. When butter stops sizzling, carefully add chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer chicken to a plate and keep warm</li>
        <li>Pour chicken broth and wine into the same skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits off the bottom of the pan. Boil about 2 minutes</li>
        <li>Stir honey and mustard into wine mixture, and simmer about 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in 1 tablespoon cold butter until melted, then stir in cream</li>
        <li>Return chicken to the skillet. Serve chicken warm with sauce. Garnish with parsley</li>
    </ol>

    Note: The flour will aid browning and help thicken the sauce, but will not form a thick crust.
